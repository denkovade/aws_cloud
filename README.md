In this repository I will try to put all my knowlage in AWS and tasks which I made on it.
First of all I will try to put some stuff related to my exam preparation and other tricky moments which I found in my daily work,
I will try to make simple scripts in bash or python to automate daily tasks in AWS cloud.
For all guides I will use my Free Tier account.
